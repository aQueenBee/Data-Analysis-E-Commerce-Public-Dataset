# Data-Analysis-E-Commerce-Public-Dataset
This project is a data analysis that aims to understand the customer feedback of an e-commerce platform based on the review scores given. The dataset used in this project contains information about customer review scores and the date the reviews were created. Through this analysis, I aim to look at the average review score, as well as the trend of review score fluctuations over time.

# Setup Environment

conda activate dashboard  
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn streamlit  

# Run Streamlit App

# Project:
